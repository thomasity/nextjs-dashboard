# Exploiting Common Web Vulnerabilities

This project is a security lab for EECS 388 that focuses on identifying and exploiting common web vulnerabilities including Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), SQL Injection, and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). It simulates attack payloads that would target a vulnerable web application and is designed for educational purposes.

## Components

### üõë Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- `csrf_0.html`, `csrf_1.html`, `csrf_2.html`: 
  - Craft malicious HTML pages that trick authenticated users into making unintended POST requests to a vulnerable server.

### üï≥Ô∏è SQL Injection
- `sql_0.txt`, `sql_1.txt`, `sql_2.txt`, `sql_2-src/`, `sql_3.txt`:
  - Construct raw SQL payloads to extract or modify sensitive database information via improperly sanitized input fields.

### üí• Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- `xss_0.txt` through `xss_4.txt`, `xss_payload.html`: 
  - Inject malicious JavaScript code to demonstrate stored, reflected, and DOM-based XSS in user profiles, comments, and URLs.

## Technologies

- HTML (for CSRF/XSS)
- Raw SQL injection payloads
- JavaScript (for XSS scripting)

## Usage

This project is intended to be tested within a controlled lab environment or course-supplied Docker container. Do not run these attack payloads on any real-world or live systems.

To test:
1. Launch the vulnerable web app (per EECS 388 instructions)
2. Load `*.html` files in a browser to simulate CSRF or XSS
3. Use `*.txt` payloads in relevant fields of the lab interface


## License

This project is for academic use only under the EECS 388 Course at the University of Michigan. Do not deploy or reuse any payloads outside of educational environments.
