# Wind Farm Performance Analysis and Visualization

This MATLAB project provides tools to analyze wind farm data and visualize key performance metrics. The project focuses on renewable energy simulation, using wind speed, turbine data, or energy output calculations.

## Features

- `analyzeWindFarm.m`: Runs the core analysis of wind farm data, which may include wind speed, turbine arrangement, and power output estimation.
- `makePlots.m`: Generates visual representations of wind farm metrics such as energy production over time or turbine performance.

## Technologies

- MATLAB for numerical analysis and plotting
- Renewable energy domain modeling

## Usage

1. Load wind farm data into the MATLAB environment.
2. Run `analyzeWindFarm.m` to process the dataset.
3. Execute `makePlots.m` to visualize the results.
