# EECS 388 Project 4 â€“ Buffer Overflow Exploitation and Shellcode Injection

This project implements a series of memory safety exploits as part of EECS 388: Computer Security. It challenges students to perform low-level buffer overflow attacks, return-to-libc exploits, and shellcode injection against vulnerable C programs. Each target demonstrates a different variation of insecure memory handling.

## Contents

- `target0.c` through `target7.c`: C programs containing various memory corruption vulnerabilities
- `sol0.py` through `sol8.py`: Exploit scripts for each corresponding target
- `shellcode.py`: Contains shellcode payload used in injected exploits
- `generate.py`: Generates configuration and challenge instances based on uniqnames
- `build.sh`: Builds targets with unique memory layouts
- `test.sh`: A helper script to run all exploits for quick verification
- `targets.pickle`: Stores randomized values for individual groups
- `read_input.c`, `cookie`: Support files for payload execution

## Technologies

- C (vulnerable binaries)
- Python 3 (exploit automation)
- Linux signals, memory layout, stack frames

## Usage

1. Build all targets:
   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```

2. Test all solutions:
   ```bash
   ./test.sh
   ```

3. Run individual exploits manually (for debugging):
   ```bash
   python3 sol0.py
   ```
